## Development server

Before running the application, add the API key to the src/environments/environment.ts file

Then, you can run `ng serve` on a terminal to run the dev server.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
